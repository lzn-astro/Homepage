    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
		I was born in Sichuan province in China, and am the only child that ever went to college in my family. As a little child, I was always attracted by the stories of scientists, like Einstein, Marie Curie, and other big names you may imagine. When I was four years old, I raised my hand at class and announced that I wanted to be a physicist. As years went by, I entered college and majored in astrophysics, which is closely related to my childhood dreams, and I am glad to find that I am still the little girl who love watching the starry sky and thinking about big questions about the universe. <br>
		
		I like jogging, hiking, surfing (haven't tried though), swimming, skiing, and any other activities that can embrace nature during my spare time, and enjoy reading books with various topics. I am also a big fan of Japanese animations, and my favorite one is Haikyu (second one being the Fulmetal Alchemist). I'm open to new things and possibilities, and would like to explore the world more in the future. <br>
		
      I am now an East Asian Core Observatories Association (<a href="https://www.eacoa.net/fellowship.php">EACOA</a>) fellow at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ),
      focusing on star formation, the interstellar medium, and multiwavelength observations of nearby galaxies.
      I am particularly interested in black hole accretion and AGN feedback.
